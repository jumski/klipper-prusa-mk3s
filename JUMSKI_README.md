# jumski overrided for dz0ny/klipper-prusa-mk3s

Config lives in printer.cfg and is based on printer.template.cfg.

The only file changed is mk3s/einsy-board.cfg because there was no way to disable
already enabled temperature_sensor, which is not present on Atomic Pi that I use instead
of Raspberry Pi.
